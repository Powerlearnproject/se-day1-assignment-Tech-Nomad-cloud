#software engineering is a systematic approach and application of engineering principles, methods and tools to design, develop, test, deploy and maintain high quality software systems and products
#software engineering is important in the technology industry by enabling and facilitating the creation of software applications and systems that improves various aspects of modern human life such as communication
the development of structured programming : programming languages adopted structured programming principles, improving code organization reducing errors and enhancing maintenace setting stage for modern programming, establishment of software engineering as a discipline: after the increasing complexities in software, software engineering was formally introduced as a structured field with systematic development methodologies, development of programming languages to improve code readability and efficiency to create more complx softwares
IDES and VCS are essential in software developmentfor collaboration and management IDES like visual studio code provides tools for coding and debugging and testing to enhance interactivity. VCS like git and github enable users to track code changes, manage versions  and collaborate with different branches. together IDES streamlines code development while VCS ensure code integrity and teaam coordination
#requirements: this involves gathering and documenting the user needs and system requirements, design: this involves creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface,  implementation: this involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications,  testing: this entails conducting various tests to ensure that the software developed meets the quality standards and functionality requirements,  deployment: releasing the software system to the users and customers and getting their feedback, maintenance: providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment
# agile methodology is an iterative and incremental approach focussed on flexibility, collaboration and responding to  change while waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases like requirements design and implementation flowing downwards
# software developer: responsible for writing the code and implementing software solutions, quality assurance engineer: ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans, project manager: oversees the planning, execution and delivery of software projects

# changing requirements: requirements may change during the development cycle leading to scope creep and project delays. this can be overcome by prioritizing important tasks, tight deadlines: pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality. this can be overcome by regular assessments of projects goals and timelines. technical debts: technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenace costs. this can be overcome by implementing agile methodologies
# unit testing: testing individual components or modules of a software, integration testing: testing the interactions between different components or subsystems, system testing: testing the entire software system as a whole, acceptance testing: testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets their needs

prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining input querries to effectively interact with AI models to ensure relevant accurate responses. it is important in optimizing the performance of ai models by reducing ambiguity and enhancing efficiency. this enables ai to generate  precise inputs and making interactions more effective. it also mitigates biases to ensure responsible and ethical use of AI 
vague prompt: tell me about technology
improved prompt: explain the impact of AI in healthcareincluding its benefits and challenges. it is effective because it focuses on specific topic such as AI in healthcare, it explicitly requests for information such as "impact" enabling the AI to provide a structured and relevant content, it is concise and direct thereby eliminating ambiguity
